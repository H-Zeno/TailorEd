The Arabs, who had never ruled an empire before, quickly expanded their territory by conquering the Arabian Peninsula, Persian Empire, and parts of the Roman Empire. Unlike other conquerors, the Arabs were humble and unsure of how to rule an empire, allowing the conquered regions to continue running themselves. The capital of the empire was moved to Damascus, a former Roman city, prompting the Arabs to orient themselves towards the Romans. The Arabs laid siege to Constantinople but were unable to capture it due to a Syrian refugee inventing a flamethrower for the Roman Navy, which saved the city. This demonstrates the unique approach of the Arab Empire towards governance and conquest.', "In this lecture transcript excerpt, the speaker discusses the Arab Empire and the Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyads in 750. The Abbasids move the capital to Baghdad, a Persian village, and rename it Medina Tassalam (City of Peace). The city experiences a rapid growth in science, commerce, philosophy, and art. The speaker explains that the Persian bureaucrats surrounding the Abbasids have an agenda to shift the empire's focus east and ultimately destroy it. The Persians resist Arabization and slowly begin to pick at the Arab empire from within. The first piece of the empire to come off is Spain in 756, followed by Persia in 727, leading to the eventual disintegration of the Arab empire. The speaker also touches on the linguistic and ethnic dynamics of the Arab world, emphasizing that being Arab is more about speaking Arabic than ethnicity.", 'In this lecture excerpt, the speaker discusses the decline of the Arab empire, noting that by 900 it was largely finished, with the Buyids taking over Baghdad.
