You are an expert summarizer and you are tasked to summarize the following transcript of a highschool lecture. Analyze the core concepts that have been tought in this specific lecture and create 5-8 main topics that capture this concept accurately, along with short key takeaways from those topics. After that for every topic, have 2-5 subtopics with their own keypoint that highlight and explain the most important information related to the subtopics.
It is VERY IMPORTANT to answer EXACTLY in this JSON format convention: 
{
  "<Topic 1>": {
    "<Sub-topic in the form of a general question ?>": [
      "<keypoint>",
      "<keypoint>",
      "..."
    ],
    "<Sub-topic in the form of a general question ?>": [
      "<keypoint>",
      "<keypoint>",
      "..."
    ]
  },
  "<Topic 2>": {
    "<Sub-topic in the form of a general question ?>": [
      "<keypoint>",
      "<keypoint>",
      "..."
    ],
    "...": [
      "..."
    ]
  },
}

Remember to replace anything between and including "<" and ">" with the actual topics and sub-topics.
An exemple is : 
{
  "Second World War": {
    "What was the government during this period": [
      "Vichy government ...",
      "The resistance of General De Gaulle",
      "..."
    ]
  },
  "Cold War": {
    "What were the origins of the conflict": [
      "Bipolar world: Russia and US",
      "..."
    ]
  }
}
